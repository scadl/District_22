This project is one of the rethinking of my reconstructions, taking into account the current trends in open graphics platforms, providing interactivity in my projects. It represents my vision of what the 22nd district of medieval Chersonesos could look like, adjacent to the southwest of the 1935 basilica. The model is designed for interactive visualization, therefore it contains a minimum of geometric details. Made by me in 2016, on the wave of hopes that it will be possible to find sponsors for the creation of an interactive reconstruction of the entire medieval Chersonesos. However, the project was cut, and the model remained in a state of development. Before importing into UE, it is optimized in the open editor Blender by dissolving pointless (in terms of geometry and triangulation) vertices and faces. The textures do not correspond to the real materials from which the buildings in Chersonesos flowed. Most of them, however, have normal and displacement maps (thanks to SSBump). Several photometric light sources are used to illuminate the scenes (mainly in a 2-storey building) with the ability to dare from surfaces up to 15 times (indirect lighting). However, to increase compatibility with cross-platform compilation, the target graphics driver is fixed to OpenGL ES3. Has built-in board help, 2 controllable cameras, an adaptive bootloader, and three cross-platform options.
